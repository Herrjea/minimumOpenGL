# minimum OpenGL

Folder structure, Makefile and .c file with the needed material to start an OpenGL project, which can be pretty annoying to set up.

All class abstractions implemented on top of OpenGL 5.
The goal of this repository is to have a starting point for a real OpenGL project, instead of having to set up everything at every beginning.

Allows mesh rendering, compiling vertex and fragment shaders and texture mapping and implements the basis for key interaction.
