# minimum OpenGL

Folder structure, Makefile and .c file with the steps needed to start an OpenGL project, which can be pretty annoying to set up.

All class abstractions impemented on top of OpenGL to allow a textured mesh to be rendered and rotated with the mouse.

The goal of this repository is to have a starting point for a real OpenGL project, instead of having to set up everything at every beginning.
